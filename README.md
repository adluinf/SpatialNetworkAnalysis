# SpatialNetworkAnalysis

Tools for network analysis of spatial networks used on the simualtions
described in [1].

More coming soon !

## Scripts:


Provide scripts that compute the network measures used to examine the structural connectivity.
- Distributions of connection distances and angles for the structural connectivity,
- In- and out-degree distributions and clustering coefficient,
- histograms and 2D maps.

TODO: describe the scripts
